# fish-cloud

some of the fish functions I've written

I want to keep them separated from my .dotfiles, because honestly people's .dotfiles are very interesting to research but lack modularity and maintainabillity (everybody just smashes a bunch of various config stuff in there, just keep it in different repos)

```fish
gfirst $repo

# prepares a repo and pushes it first commit to github
```

```fish
mid $song

# transforms a mid recording to mp3
```
